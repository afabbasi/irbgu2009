<title> New Hydroelectric Projects 

<desc> Description: 
Identify hydroelectric projects proposed or under construction by
country and location.  Detailed description of nature, extent,
purpose, problems, and consequences is desirable.

<narr> Narrative: 
Relevant documents would contain as a minimum a clear statement 
that a hydroelectric project is planned or construction is under 
way and the location of the project.  Renovation of existing
facilities would be judged not relevant unless plans call for a
significant increase in acre-feet or reservoir or a marked change
in the environmental impact of the project.  Arguments for and
against proposed projects are relevant as long as they are supported 
by specifics, including as a minimum the name or location of the
project.  A statement that an individual or organization is for or

<title> Implant Dentistry 

<desc> Description: 
What are the advantages and/or disadvantages of tooth implants?

<narr> Narrative: 
A tooth replacement procedure, begun in the 1960s by Doctor
Branemark, is becoming more widely used today.  It involves 
the replacement of a lost tooth/teeth by an implantation 
process which secures the fabricated tooth to a titanium post
with an adhesive resulting in a stable and sturdy denture 
almost like the original.  A relevant document will include 
any clinical experiment, report, study, paper, or medical 
discussion which describes the advantages or disadvantages of 
tooth implant(s), conditions under which such a procedure is 
favorable, denture comfort and function compared to false teeth, 
bridge, or plate and comparative cost differential.

<title> Industrial Espionage 

<desc> Description: 
Document will discuss the theft of trade secrets along with 
the sources of information:  trade journals, business meetings,
data from Patent Offices, trade shows, or analysis of a 
competitor's products.

<narr> Narrative: 
A relevant document will contain specific information on the
theft of trade secrets on new or existing technology.  Relevant
information includes, but is not limited to, espionage in the
highly competitive fashion industry, toy companies, drug firms,
and computer companies.  An apparently legal way of stealing
company secrets is by using the Freedom of Information Act, 
passed by the U.S. Congress in 1966 to help people and the 
press get information for the public good.  The law has often
been used instead by companies for private gain.  Documents
discussing company counterespionage are also considered to be
relevant.
